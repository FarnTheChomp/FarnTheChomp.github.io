      'Norfec is the Head of Office at Frostbound Glacial Excavation, a company specializing in the extraction of ancient relics in the northern region of Oddworld. The company\'s activities, while focused on unearthing the past, have significant impacts on the local environment and the spiritual heritage of the area. As a Glukkon, Norfec is known for his cold and calculating demeanor. Unlike his peers, he is not driven by pride and harbors his own suspicions regarding the potential uprising of the Mudokons. This work is a 3D sculpt of an original fan character created for the Oddworld game series.',

    description:
      'A digital sculpt of Art the Clown, the iconic antagonist from the Terrifier franchise. Art is defined by his unsettling mime-like appearance and absolute silence, communicating entirely through exaggerated expressions and gesture. This sculpt captures his signature pale visage, the grotesque grin, and the theatrical menace that has made him a defining figure in modern horror. A study in character likeness and expressive anatomy.',
